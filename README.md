# Error and Uncertainty Series Analyzer

This software provides tools for importing, analyzing, and exporting error and uncertainty data from simulation series in CSV format. It supports calculating various objective functions (such as RMSE, MAE, BIAS, r, r¬≤, and NSE) and generating uncertainty measures using the 95PPU, R-Factor, and P-Factor theory [1]. The results can be exported to an Excel report (.xlsx), including plots.

## Error Equations

### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\text{RMSE}&space;=&space;\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}&space;\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(y_i&space;-&space;\hat{y}_i)^2}" alt="RMSE Equation">

RMSE is a measure of the differences between values predicted by a model and the values observed. It penalizes larger errors more significantly due to the square root term.

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\text{MAE}&space;=&space;\frac{1}{n}&space;\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;|y_i&space;-&space;\hat{y}_i|">

MAE is a measure of the average absolute errors between predicted values and observed values. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to RMSE.

### Bias (BIAS)

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\text{BIAS}&space;=&space;\frac{1}{n}&space;\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(y_i&space;-&space;\hat{y}_i)">

BIAS represents the bias or systematic tendency of predicted values relative to observed values. A positive value indicates that predictions are generally overestimated.

### Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{300}&space;r&space;=&space;\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(y_i&space;-&space;\bar{y})(\hat{y}_i&space;-&space;\bar{\hat{y}})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(y_i&space;-&space;\bar{y})^2&space;\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(\hat{y}_i&space;-&space;\bar{\hat{y}})^2}}">

The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) measures the linear relationship between two variables, in this case, between observed values (y) and predicted values (ùë¶^y^ ). The value of r ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicates no linear correlation.

### Coefficient of Determination (r¬≤)

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{300}&space;r^2&space;=&space;\left(&space;\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(y_i&space;-&space;\bar{y})(\hat{y}_i&space;-&space;\bar{\hat{y}})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(y_i&space;-&space;\bar{y})^2&space;\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(\hat{y}_i&space;-&space;\bar{\hat{y}})^2}}&space;\right)^2">

The coefficient of determination (r¬≤) is a measure of the proportion of the total variance in observed values that is explained by the model. A value of r¬≤ close to 1 indicates that the model explains the variation in the observed data well.

### Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\text{NSE}&space;=&space;1&space;-&space;\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(y_i&space;-&space;\hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}&space;(y_i&space;-&space;\bar{y})^2}">

NSE is an efficiency measure that compares the variability of the simulation (predicted values) with the variability of the observed data. A NSE value greater than zero indicates that the simulation performs better than the mean of the observed data.

These equations are used to evaluate the performance and uncertainty of simulation models within the software.

## Input Table Requirements

- CSV file with data from simulations.

### Example CSV File Structure (example_csv_file.csv):

| Date       | Observed | SIM1    | SIM2    | SIM3    | SIM4    | SIM5  | SIM6    | ...     |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| 01/01/2008 | 6.5699   | 9.14    | 11.18   | 11.5187 | 12.3320 | 13.32 | 12.8742 | ...     |
| 02/01/2008 | 6.5699   | 8.85    | 10.72   | 10.9041 | 11.6228 | 12.58 | 11.9903 | ...     |
| 03/01/2008 | 6.098    | 8.06    | 9.9     | 10.0471 | 10.7403 | 11.71 | 11.1084 | ...     |

#### Notes

- Ensure the CSV file follows the correct format: The first column should be the date, the second column the observed data, and subsequent columns the simulation data. The CSV file should not contain NaN values, and all series must have the same dimensions.
- The separator used should be ';'.
- An example.csv (example_csv_file.csv) file is provided with programn exe.

**Note:** It is not allowed NaN values in the series and all series (columns) must have the same dimensions.
